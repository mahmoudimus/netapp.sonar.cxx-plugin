This documention is as close to the published C++11 Standard as we
could find and should be quite accurate. However, it contains at least
the following flaws:

- the rule alignment-specifier should refers to assignment-exression
  instead of alignment-expression
- Unconfirmed: nested-name-specifier should match to "::", but it doesnt.
